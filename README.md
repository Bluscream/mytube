# myTube!

The best YouTube experience around.

myTube is a YouTube app built to keep your video playing no matter what. By lightly fading the video into the background, you can continue to watch while you read comments, browse channels and videos, and everything else you can do in the app. If you can do something in the app, then you can do it while watching a video!

myTube even can play the audio of videos in the background while you use another app ;)
